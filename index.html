      <h1>Political Beliefs Meter</h1>
      <h3>A political beliefs meter that asks you questions about your values and tells you how liberal or conservative you are.</h3>
      <h1>On government, security, and charity.</h1>

      <form id="political-beliefs">
        <label for"government">Government: Government should serve the people, not the other way around.</label>

          <option value="0">Disagree</option>

        <label for"security">Security: The legitimate functions of our national government are to provide security through a strong defense and to protect freedom for the individual, so that people can pursue their own goals.</label>

        <label for"charity">Charity: No one has an obligation to help a stranger involuntarily. Charity should be a personal decision. Encouraging voluntary giving would be better for America's soul than seizing our money against our will, for purposes we don't approve of.</label>
